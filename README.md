# Design Patterns
This project implements a series of design patterns in Java. Each design pattern is applied to a specific context and provides proven solutions to recurring software design problems. The design patterns implemented in this project are:

- **Singleton:** This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to that instance.

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** The MVC pattern separates the business logic (model), presentation (view), and user interaction (controller), allowing for better organization and code maintenance.

- **Observer:** The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, so that when an object changes its state, all its observers are notified and updated automatically.

- **Prototype:** The Prototype pattern allows creating new objects by cloning an existing object, thereby avoiding direct object creation and improving performance.

- **Factory Method:** The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which concrete classes to instantiate.

- **Template Method:** The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and allows subclasses to override specific steps of that algorithm without changing its overall structure.

- **Command:** The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undo operations.

- **Builder:** The Builder pattern provides a way to construct complex objects step by step, allowing you to create different representations of the same object.

- **State:** The State pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, encapsulating each state in a separate class and allowing the object to change state dynamically.

- **Visitor:** The Visitor pattern allows adding new operations to a class hierarchy without modifying those classes, by separating the operations into visitor classes.

- **Composite:** The Composite pattern groups objects into a tree structure, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

- **Decorator:** The Decorator pattern dynamically adds additional responsibilities to an object, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionalities.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into packages, each corresponding to a specific design pattern. Each package contains the classes and interfaces related to the implementation of that design pattern.

The available packages are:

- singleton: Implementation of the Singleton pattern.
- mvc: Implementation of the MVC pattern.
- observer: Implementation of the Observer pattern.
- prototype: Implementation of the Prototype pattern.
- factorymethod: Implementation of the Factory Method pattern.
- templatemethod: Implementation of the Template Method pattern.
- command: Implementation of the Command pattern.
- builder: Implementation of the Builder pattern.
- state: Implementation of the State pattern.
- visitor: Implementation of the Visitor pattern.
- composite: Implementation of the Composite pattern.
- decorator: Implementation of the Decorator pattern.
# How to Run
- Clone this repository.
- Open the project in your preferred IDE.
- Navigate to the main class related to the design pattern you want to run.
- Run the main class to see the demonstration of the design pattern in action.
- Feel free to explore the source code in each package and study the implementations in detail.

I hope this project is useful for understanding and applying the mentioned design patterns. Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or make additional improvements. Have fun exploring the design patterns!
